COUNTY GOVERNMENTS BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT FY 2024/25 
AUGUST , 2025
FOREWORD
T
he FY 2024/2025 County Governments Budget Implementation Review Report (CBIRR) provides a thorough 
analysis of the budget performance of the forty-seven County Governments. It examines various aspects, 
including receipts to the County Revenue Fund, issues related to the exchequer, expenditures, and funds 
absorption relative to the approved budget. Additionally, the report tracks pending bills and revenue arrears. It 
identifies key issues that hindered budget implementation during the FY 2024/2025 and offers recommendations to 
address these challenges.
This report is prepared per Article 228 (6) of the Constitution, which mandates the Controller of Budget to submit a 
report on the implementation of the budgets of the National and County Governments to each House of Parliament 
every four months. Furthermore, it aligns with Section 9 of the Controller of Budget Act, 2016, which outlines the 
required contents of budget implementation reports. The report serves as a means for the Controller of Budget to 
disseminate information about budget implementation at the County Government level, as stipulated in Section 39 
(8) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.
To compile this report, financial and non-financial data were reviewed and analysed, including reports submitted to 
the Controller of Budget under Sections 166 and 168 of the Public Finance Management Act. It draws on data from 
the Integrated Financial Management Information System and the approved budgets for FY 2024/2025. Continuous 
monitoring of budget implementation by the Office of the Controller of Budget further enhances the findings of this 
report.
This report will be valuable to the Legislature and Executive branches of County Governments and the public by 
increasing awareness of budget implementation and improving the management of public funds. I encourage the 
public and other stakeholders to use this report to scrutinise how County Governments are utilising public funds.
The preparation of this report was made possible through the dedication and hard work of the Controller of Budget 
staff and County Government personnel, whom I would like to acknowledge and greatly appreciate.

COUNTY GOVERNMENTS BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT FY 2024/25

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
T
his County Budget Implementation Review Report for FY 2024/25 covers July 2024 to June 
2025. It is prepared in compliance with Article 228(6) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, and 
Section 9 of the Controller of Budget Act, 2016. The report reviews budget implementation for 
each of the 47 County Governments by assessing revenue collection and expenditure performance. It 
also highlights the common/crosscutting challenges encountered during budget implementation and 
offers recommendations for addressing these issues.
In FY 2024/25, the County Assemblies approved a combined budget for the County Governments 
amounting to Kshs.601.69 billion. Of this, Kshs.218.99 billion (36 per cent) was allocated to develop-
ment expenditure, and Kshs.382.70 billion (64 per cent) was allocated to recurrent expenditure. The 
allocation for development expenditure conformed to Section 107(2)(b) of the PFM Act, 2012, which 
stipulated that at least 30 per cent of the budget should be allocated for development expenditure. 
To fund the FY 2024/25 budgets, the County Governments expected to receive Kshs.387.43 billion as 
the equitable share of revenue raised nationally; Kshs.30.83 billion in arrears of the equitable share of 
revenue raised nationally for June 2024, relating to FY 2023/24; projected to raise Kshs.87.67 billion 
from own sources of revenue, which comprised Kshs.20.77 billion from the Facility Improvement 
Fund (FIF)/Appropriation in Aid (A-I-A) and Kshs.66.90 billion from ordinary revenue collections; 
and projected Kshs.24.92 billion of unspent funds carried forward from FY 2023/24. Additionally, the 
Counties expected to receive Kshs.70.84 billion as County additional allocations from the National 
Government and Development Partners.
The actual total funds available to the County Governments in FY 2024/25 amounted to Kshs.533.11 
billion. These included Kshs.387.43 billion as the equitable share of revenue raised nationally, and au-
thorised for withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund to respective County Revenue Funds (CRF) ac-
counts by the Controller of Budget in accordance with Article 206(4) of the Constitution; Kshs.30.83 
billion in arrears for June 2024, relating to FY 2023/24 equitable share of revenue raised nationally; 
Kshs.24.86 billion as additional allocations; Kshs.22.69 billion as cash balances brought forward from 
FY 2023/24; and Kshs.67.30 billion as revenue generated from own sources, which included the Facil-
ity Improvement Fund (FIF)/Appropriation in Aid (A-I-A) of Kshs.24.59 billion.
In FY 2024/25, the County Governments generated Kshs.67.30 billion from local revenue sources, 
accounting for 77 per cent of their cumulative annual local revenue target of Kshs.87.67 billion. This 
represented a 62.6 per cent increase compared to Kshs.41.40 billion realised in FY 2023/24. The fol -
lowing Counties exceeded their annual local revenue collection targets: Kisii at 178 per cent, Tana 
River at 133 per cent, Mandera and Wajir both at 123 per cent, Kirinyaga at 122 per cent, Garissa at 
120 per cent, Vihiga at 117 per cent, Samburu at 110 per cent, Meru at 106 per cent, Elgeyo Marakwet 
at 104 per cent, and Homa Bay at 101 per cent. This increase was attributed to various factors, includ-
ing underbudgeting, a complete lack of budgeting for the Facility Improvement Fund (FIF), revamped 
revenue streams, and the increased automation of revenue collection processes.
In contrast, some Counties recorded own-source revenue (OSR) performance of less than 70 per cent, 
including Nairobi City at 66 per cent, Kakamega, Kisumu, and Bungoma each at 65 per cent, Taita 
Taveta at 64 per cent, Isiolo at 58 per cent, Machakos at 56 per cent, Kajiado at 55 per cent, and Siaya 
at 47 per cent.
As of June 30, 2025, County Governments reported a total of Kshs.124.95 billion in outstanding rev-
enue arrears. This sum encompasses ordinary OSR arrears of Kshs.112.47 billion, Kshs.7.46 billion 
from the Social Health Insurance Fund, and Kshs.5.01 billion from the defunct National Health Insur-

ance Fund. Nairobi City County accounted for the highest share of these arrears, totalling Kshs.63.52 
billion, representing 51 per cent of the overall arrears, followed by Mombasa (Kshs.13.75 billion), 
Nakuru (Kshs.12.59 billion), and Kajiado (Kshs.12.09 billion). 
In FY 2024/25, the Controller of Budget authorised withdrawals of Kshs.418.26 billion from the Con-
solidated Fund to various CRF accounts, representing the Counties’ equitable share of revenue raised 
nationally, per Article 206(4) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. This amount included Kshs.30.83 
billion in arrears for June 2024, relating to the FY 2023/24 equitable share of revenue raised nationally.
The Controller of Budget further authorised withdrawals of Kshs.469.34 billion from the CRF ac -
counts to the County Operational Accounts for the County Governments in accordance with Article 
207(3) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. Of this amount, Kshs.347.39 billion was allocated to vari -
ous expenditures. Of this amount, Kshs.347.39 billion (74 per cent) was for recurrent expenditure and 
Kshs.121.95 billion (26 per cent) was for development expenditure. This represented an increase of 4 
per cent from Kshs . 451.21 billion, authorised in FY 2023/24.
During the reporting period, County Governments allocated Kshs.470.74 billion in total expendi -
tures, comprising Kshs.346.98 billion (74 per cent) for recurrent activities and Kshs.123.76 billion (26 
per cent) for development initiatives. This resulted in an overall budget absorption rate of 78 per cent, 
a slight decline from the 80 per cent absorption rate recorded in the same period of FY 2023/24, when 
cumulative expenditures were Kshs.446.76 billion against a budget of Kshs.562.75 billion. Counties 
achieving the highest absorption rates included Nandi (98 per cent), Narok (90 per cent), and West 
Pokot, Meru, and Trans Nzoia (89 per cent). Conversely, some Counties, namely Kwale, Nakuru, Kisii, 
Isiolo, and Kisumu, recorded the lowest aggregate absorption rates at 68 per cent, 67 per cent, 66 per 
cent, 63 per cent, and 62 per cent, respectively.
Recurrent expenditures totalled Kshs.346.98 billion, representing 91 per cent of the annual budget for 
recurrent activities. This is consistent with the absorption rate of 91 per cent in FY 2023/24, where 
recurrent spending was Kshs.337.53 billion. Of the total recurrent expenditure, Kshs.220.64 billion 
was incurred for employee compensation, while Kshs.126.34 billion (36 per cent) was incurred for 
operations and maintenance.
The County Assemblies reported expenditures of Kshs.1.57 billion on MCAs' sitting allowances, 
equivalent to 87 per cent of the approved budget of Kshs.1.80 billion for FY 2024/25, reflecting a slight 
improvement from the previous fiscal year.
Development expenditures reached Kshs.123.76 billion, demonstrating a 57 per cent absorption rate 
of the annual development budget of Kshs.218.99 billion—a decrease from the previous year's 58 per 
cent. The Counties that attained the highest absorption rates of their respective approved development 
budgets included Nandi at 90 per cent, Trans Nzoia at 77 per cent, Narok at 74 per cent, Meru at 73 
per cent, and Kericho, Mandera, and Kirinyaga each at 72 per cent. In contrast, the Counties with the 
lowest absorption rates of their respective approved development budgets included Machakos at 41 
per cent, Kisii at 40 per cent, Elgeyo Marakwet at 39 per cent, Kiambu and Nyamira each at 37 per 
cent, and Nairobi City and Kisumu each at 29 per cent.
As of June 30, 2025, the outstanding stock of pending bills amounted to Kshs.176.80 billion, marking 
a 3 per cent decrease from Kshs.181.98 billion in FY 2023/24. This reduction was primarily attrib -
utable to the reconciliation of pending bills in Nairobi City County, which decreased by Kshs.39.78 
billion. Significant pending bill balances were reported by Nairobi City (Kshs.86.77 billion), Kiambu 
(Kshs.7.89 billion), and Machakos (Kshs.6.73 billion). In contrast, Narok's pending bill data was in -
complete, hindering a comprehensive assessment of compliance and progress.

AUGUST , 2025
In FY 2024/25, the Controller of Budget identified critical challenges impeding effective budget exe -
cution across County Governments. Key issues include significant underperformance in Own Source 
Revenue, where Counties missed their target of Kshs.87.67 billion by 23 per cent. High revenue ar -
rears of Kshs.124.95 billion, exacerbating fiscal pressures. Overreliance on the Facility Improvement 
Fund, which accounted for over 50 per cent of OSR for many Counties, poses a risk to financial sus -
tainability. Additionally, pending bills soared to Kshs.176.80 billion, with over half being under three 
years old. At the same time, development expenditures remained alarmingly low, as 23 Counties failed 
to meet the 30 per cent threshold. 
The expenditure landscape reveals excessive spending on employee compensation, with only eight 
Counties staying within the 35 per cent regulatory ceiling. Furthermore, the health sector's wage bill 
accounts for 44 per cent of total expenditures, raising concerns about financial management. Other 
challenges include lapsing fund regulations, non-compliance with account opening legislation, and 
delays submitting mandatory financial reports.
To rectify these issues in subsequent financial years, the Controller of Budget recommends the follow-
ing strategic actions for County Governments: Develop realistic strategies to expand OSR and reduce 
reliance on the Facility Improvement Fund; establish mechanisms to collect outstanding revenues and 
amend legislation to incorporate pending bills into public debt definitions, ensure enhanced fiscal 
accountability; adhere strictly to legal spending limits, particularly on employee compensation, and 
prioritize sustainable development by effectively implementing growth-oriented programmes; review 
and revise outdated fund regulations to prevent disruptions and halt expenditures from lapsed funds.
During FY 2024/25, monitoring and evaluation by the Controller of Budget across 36 County Gov -
ernments revealed mixed project outcomes. While some initiatives progressed on schedule, others 
faced significant delays and contract management weaknesses. Also, challenges were observed in the 
procurement of medical supplies. Additionally, evaluations of equalisation-funded projects raised 
concerns regarding their effectiveness and ability to bridge service delivery gaps. Ultimately, the Con-
troller of Budget's recommendations focus on cultivating fiscal responsibility and enhancing opera -
tional transparency, ensuring County Governments can navigate these challenges and drive sustain -
able growth for their communities.
