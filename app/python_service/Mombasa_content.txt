COUNTY GOVERNMENTS BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT FY 2024/25
AUGUST , 2025
3.27.16 Key Observations and Recommendations
In the course of overseeing and reporting on the implementation of the County budget, the CoB identified the fol-
lowing challenges, which hampered effective budget implementation;
i. Unspent funds from FY 2023/24 were not refunded into the CRF account, resulting in actual expenditures 
exceeding the approved exchequer issues in four departments, as shown in Table 3.336 on development 
budget. 
ii. Regulation 197(1)(i) of the Public Finance Management (County Governments) Regulations, 2015, limits 
the lifespan of public funds to 10 years unless extended by the County Assembly. During the reporting peri-
od, the CoB found that the lifespan of the County Education Bursary Fund and the County Scholarships & 
Educational Benefits Fund had expired, making them ineligible for further withdrawals.
iii. Use of manual payroll. Personnel emoluments amounting to Kshs.147.39 million for 713 casual staff and 
3,388 Community Health Promoters (CHVs) were processed through manual payroll accounting for 4 per 
cent of the total payroll cost. Manual payroll is prone to abuse and may result in the loss of public funds.
iv. During FY2024/25, health facilities were owed a combined total of Kshs.212.28 million across the two 
schemes—SHIF and the defunct NHIF .
The County should implement the following recommendations to improve budget execution:
i. The County Treasury should ensure unspent funds from the previous financial year are deposited into the CRF 
Account in line with Section 136 of the PFM Act 2012.
ii. The County should ensure the timely review and extension of public funds whose lifespan is nearing expiration 
to prevent operational disruptions. Additionally, any expenditure from lapsed funds should cease immediately, 
and legal mechanisms should be followed to re-establish or wind up such funds in compliance with the Public 
Finance Management Act.
iii. The Government requires that salaries be processed through the HRIS system, and the County is advised to 
fast-track the acquisition of Unified Personnel Numbers for their casual staff. The County Public Service Board 
should regulate staff engagement on contract and casual workers as provided under Section 74 of the County 
Governments Act 2012. Furthermore, strict adherence to the approved staff establishment should be main-
tained.
iv. The County Leadership should liaise with the Social Health Authority for the settlement of outstanding claims.

3.28.1 Overview of FY 2024/25 Budget
The Mombasa County Approved Supplementary I Budget for FY 2024/25 was Kshs.17.36 billion. It comprised 
Kshs.5.52 billion (32 per cent) and Kshs.11.84 billion (68 per cent) allocation for development and recurrent pro -
grammes, respectively. The budget estimates represented an increase of Kshs.1.37 billion (9 per cent) from the FY 
2023/24 budget comprised a development budget of Kshs.4.80 billion and a recurrent budget of Kshs.11.19 billion. 
The increase in the budget was primarily attributed to growth in revenue. 
The budget was to be financed from various revenue sources, including the equitable share of revenue raised nation-
ally, amounting to Kshs.7.90 billion (46 per cent), additional allocations of Kshs.2.17 million (12 per cent), a cash 
balance of Kshs.363.74 million (2 per cent) brought forward from FY 2023/24, and Kshs.6.93 billion (40 per cent) 
generated as own-source revenue. The own-source revenue comprised Kshs.5.68 billion (33 per cent) deposited into 
the CRF and Kshs.1.25 billion (7 per cent) as the Facility Improvement Financing (revenue from health facilities). A 
breakdown of the additional allocations is shown in Table 3.337.
3.28.2 Revenue Performance
The County received Kshs.14.73 billion in revenues in the review period to fund its development and recurrent 
activities. This amount represented an increase of 7 per cent compared to the amount received in FY 2023/24 of 
Kshs.13.81 billion. The total revenue consisted of Kshs.7.90 billion from the equitable share of revenue raised nation-
ally. Other revenue streams were additional allocations from the national government and development partners of 
Kshs.1.34 billion and own-source revenue (OSR) collection of Kshs.5.13 billion. Additionally, the County had a cash 
balance of Kshs.363.74 million from FY 2023/24. 
The total OSR collection of Kshs.5.13 billion included Facilities Improvement Financing (FIF) of Kshs.916.99 mil -
lion, and Kshs.4.21 billion from other OSR sources. Table 3.337 summarises the total revenue available to the County 
Government during FY 2024/25.

COUNTY GOVERNMENTS BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT FY 2024/25
AUGUST , 2025
During the year, the County generated Kshs.5.13 billion from its revenue sources, including FIF . This amount was a 
decrease of 8 per cent compared to Kshs.5.59 billion realised in a similar period in FY 2023/24, and was 74 per cent 
of the annual target and 65 per cent of the equitable revenue share disbursed. The OSR included revenue arrears and 
penalties charged on fees and levies from previous financial years, amounting to Kshs.1.51 billion.
The revenue streams which contributed the highest OSR receipts are shown in Figure 110.
Figure 110: Mombasa County Top Own Source Revenue Streams in FY 2024/25 
Source: Mombasa County Treasury 
As shown in Figure 110, the highest revenue stream, at Kshs.1.4 billion, was from Public health services fees, which 
account for 27 per cent of the total OSR receipts. The County Government has automated all its revenue streams.

3.28.5 Exchequers Approved

comprised Kshs.3.47 billion (25 per cent) for development programmes and Kshs.10.25 billion (75 per cent) for re-
current programmes. Analysis of the recurrent exchequers released indicates that Kshs.6.80 billion was for employee

diture represented 99 per cent of the total funds released by the CoB. It comprised Kshs.3.34 billion for development 
programmes and Kshs.10.09 billion for recurrent programmes. Expenditure on development programmes repre -
sented an absorption rate of 62 per cent, while recurrent expenditure represented 85 per cent of the annual recurrent 
expenditure budget.
3.28.7 Settlement of Pending Bills
As of 30 June 2024, the County reported pending bills totalling Kshs.4.47 billion. This amount included Kshs.4.46 
billion from the County Executive and Kshs.16.99 million from the County Assembly. The pending bills from the

The County Executive and the Assembly submitted a pending bills payment plan, committing to pay Kshs.739.99 
million and Kshs.24.88 million, respectively, in FY 2024/25. The County adhered to this payment plan, as it cleared

From the pending bills analysis, the OCOB established that pending bills accumulated for over three years make up 
80 per cent of the total compared to those under one year. The County treasury is, therefore, to pay pending bills on 
a FIFO basis (First In, First Out) and ensure compliance with the Pending Bills Action Plan.
3.28.8  Expenditure by Economic Classification
The County Executive incurred Kshs.6.55 billion for compensation of employees, Kshs.2.60 billion for operations 
and maintenance, and Kshs.3.37 billion for development activities. Similarly, the County Assembly spent Kshs.389.67 
million on compensation of employees, Kshs.351.17 million on operations and maintenance, and Kshs.64.82 million 
on development activities, as shown in Table 3.341.

3.28.9 Expenditure on Compensation of Employees 
During the period under review, the expenditure on employee compensation totalled Kshs.6.94 billion. Therefore, 
the percentage of compensation of employees to adjusted revenue in line with Regulation 25(1)(c) of the PRM 
(County Governments) Regulations 2015, was 47 per cent. This expenditure on employee compensation shows a de-
crease compared to the Kshs.6.86 billion reported in FY 2023/24. Of this total, Kshs.3.28 billion related to the Health 
Sector employees, which accounted for 47 per cent of the overall employees’ compensation.
Figure 111 shows the compensation trend of employees’ expenditures as a percentage of total revenue received from 
FY 2019/20 to FY 2024/25.

In FY 2024/25, the County reported collections of Kshs.916.99 million as FIF , which was 73 per cent of the annual

ment Financing Act, 2023. The County has developed regulations to operationalise the FIF Act of 2023.
