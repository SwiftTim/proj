**BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT**


**FY 2024/2025**


**AUGUST, 2025**


###### **FOREWORD**

he FY 2024/2025 County Governments Budget Implementation Review Report (CBIRR) provides a thorough
analysis of the budget performance of the forty-seven County Governments. It examines various aspects,
including receipts to the County Revenue Fund, issues related to the exchequer, expenditures, and funds
### Tabsorption relative to the approved budget. Additionally, the report tracks pending bills and revenue arrears. It

identifies key issues that hindered budget implementation during the FY 2024/2025 and offers recommendations to
address these challenges.

This report is prepared per Article 228 (6) of the Constitution, which mandates the Controller of Budget to submit a
report on the implementation of the budgets of the National and County Governments to each House of Parliament
every four months. Furthermore, it aligns with Section 9 of the Controller of Budget Act, 2016, which outlines the
required contents of budget implementation reports. The report serves as a means for the Controller of Budget to
disseminate information about budget implementation at the County Government level, as stipulated in Section 39
(8) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2012.

To compile this report, financial and non-financial data were reviewed and analysed, including reports submitted to
the Controller of Budget under Sections 166 and 168 of the Public Finance Management Act. It draws on data from
the Integrated Financial Management Information System and the approved budgets for FY 2024/2025. Continuous
monitoring of budget implementation by the Office of the Controller of Budget further enhances the findings of this
report.

This report will be valuable to the Legislature and Executive branches of County Governments and the public by
increasing awareness of budget implementation and improving the management of public funds. I encourage the
public and other stakeholders to use this report to scrutinise how County Governments are utilising public funds.

The preparation of this report was made possible through the dedication and hard work of the Controller of Budget
staff and County Government personnel, whom I would like to acknowledge and greatly appreciate.

COUNTY GOVERNMENTS BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION REVIEW REPORT FY 2024/25



**ii**



AUGUST, 2025


###### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

his County Budget Implementation Review Report for FY 2024/25 covers July 2024 to June
2025. It is prepared in compliance with Article 228(6) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010, and
Section 9 of the Controller of Budget Act, 2016. The report reviews budget implementation for
## Teach of the 47 County Governments by assessing revenue collection and expenditure performance. It

also highlights the common/crosscutting challenges encountered during budget implementation and
offers recommendations for addressing these issues.


In FY 2024/25, the County Assemblies approved a combined budget for the County Governments
amounting to Kshs.601.69 billion. Of this, Kshs.218.99 billion (36 per cent) was allocated to development expenditure, and Kshs.382.70 billion (64 per cent) was allocated to recurrent expenditure. The
allocation for development expenditure conformed to Section 107(2)(b) of the PFM Act, 2012, which
stipulated that at least 30 per cent of the budget should be allocated for development expenditure.


To fund the FY 2024/25 budgets, the County Governments expected to receive Kshs.387.43 billion as
the equitable share of revenue raised nationally; Kshs.30.83 billion in arrears of the equitable share of
revenue raised nationally for June 2024, relating to FY 2023/24; projected to raise Kshs.87.67 billion
from own sources of revenue, which comprised Kshs.20.77 billion from the Facility Improvement
Fund (FIF)/Appropriation in Aid (A-I-A) and Kshs.66.90 billion from ordinary revenue collections;
and projected Kshs.24.92 billion of unspent funds carried forward from FY 2023/24. Additionally, the
Counties expected to receive Kshs.70.84 billion as County additional allocations from the National
Government and Development Partners.


The actual total funds available to the County Governments in FY 2024/25 amounted to Kshs.533.11
billion. These included Kshs.387.43 billion as the equitable share of revenue raised nationally, and authorised for withdrawal from the Consolidated Fund to respective County Revenue Funds (CRF) accounts by the Controller of Budget in accordance with Article 206(4) of the Constitution; Kshs.30.83
billion in arrears for June 2024, relating to FY 2023/24 equitable share of revenue raised nationally;
Kshs.24.86 billion as additional allocations; Kshs.22.69 billion as cash balances brought forward from
FY 2023/24; and Kshs.67.30 billion as revenue generated from own sources, which included the Facility Improvement Fund (FIF)/Appropriation in Aid (A-I-A) of Kshs.24.59 billion.


In FY 2024/25, the County Governments generated Kshs.67.30 billion from local revenue sources,
accounting for 77 per cent of their cumulative annual local revenue target of Kshs.87.67 billion. This
represented a 62.6 per cent increase compared to Kshs.41.40 billion realised in FY 2023/24. The following Counties exceeded their annual local revenue collection targets: Kisii at 178 per cent, Tana
River at 133 per cent, Mandera and Wajir both at 123 per cent, Kirinyaga at 122 per cent, Garissa at
120 per cent, Vihiga at 117 per cent, Samburu at 110 per cent, Meru at 106 per cent, Elgeyo Marakwet
at 104 per cent, and Homa Bay at 101 per cent. This increase was attributed to various factors, including underbudgeting, a complete lack of budgeting for the Facility Improvement Fund (FIF), revamped
revenue streams, and the increased automation of revenue collection processes.


In contrast, some Counties recorded own-source revenue (OSR) performance of less than 70 per cent,
including Nairobi City at 66 per cent, Kakamega, Kisumu, and Bungoma each at 65 per cent, Taita
Taveta at 64 per cent, Isiolo at 58 per cent, Machakos at 56 per cent, Kajiado at 55 per cent, and Siaya
at 47 per cent.


As of June 30, 2025, County Governments reported a total of Kshs.124.95 billion in outstanding revenue arrears. This sum encompasses ordinary OSR arrears of Kshs.112.47 billion, Kshs.7.46 billion
from the Social Health Insurance Fund, and Kshs.5.01 billion from the defunct National Health Insur

ance Fund. Nairobi City County accounted for the highest share of these arrears, totalling Kshs.63.52
billion, representing 51 per cent of the overall arrears, followed by Mombasa (Kshs.13.75 billion),
Nakuru (Kshs.12.59 billion), and Kajiado (Kshs.12.09 billion).


In FY 2024/25, the Controller of Budget authorised withdrawals of Kshs.418.26 billion from the Consolidated Fund to various CRF accounts, representing the Counties’ equitable share of revenue raised
nationally, per Article 206(4) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. This amount included Kshs.30.83
billion in arrears for June 2024, relating to the FY 2023/24 equitable share of revenue raised nationally.


The Controller of Budget further authorised withdrawals of Kshs.469.34 billion from the CRF accounts to the County Operational Accounts for the County Governments in accordance with Article
207(3) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010. Of this amount, Kshs.347.39 billion was allocated to various expenditures. Of this amount, Kshs.347.39 billion (74 per cent) was for recurrent expenditure and
Kshs.121.95 billion (26 per cent) was for development expenditure. This represented an increase of 4
per cent from Kshs . 451.21 billion, authorised in FY 2023/24.


During the reporting period, County Governments allocated Kshs.470.74 billion in total expenditures, comprising Kshs.346.98 billion (74 per cent) for recurrent activities and Kshs.123.76 billion (26
per cent) for development initiatives. This resulted in an overall budget absorption rate of 78 per cent,
a slight decline from the 80 per cent absorption rate recorded in the same period of FY 2023/24, when
cumulative expenditures were Kshs.446.76 billion against a budget of Kshs.562.75 billion. Counties
achieving the highest absorption rates included Nandi (98 per cent), Narok (90 per cent), and West
Pokot, Meru, and Trans Nzoia (89 per cent). Conversely, some Counties, namely Kwale, Nakuru, Kisii,
Isiolo, and Kisumu, recorded the lowest aggregate absorption rates at 68 per cent, 67 per cent, 66 per
cent, 63 per cent, and 62 per cent, respectively.


Recurrent expenditures totalled Kshs.346.98 billion, representing 91 per cent of the annual budget for
recurrent activities. This is consistent with the absorption rate of 91 per cent in FY 2023/24, where
recurrent spending was Kshs.337.53 billion. Of the total recurrent expenditure, Kshs.220.64 billion
was incurred for employee compensation, while Kshs.126.34 billion (36 per cent) was incurred for
operations and maintenance.


The County Assemblies reported expenditures of Kshs.1.57 billion on MCAs' sitting allowances,
equivalent to 87 per cent of the approved budget of Kshs.1.80 billion for FY 2024/25, reflecting a slight
improvement from the previous fiscal year.


Development expenditures reached Kshs.123.76 billion, demonstrating a 57 per cent absorption rate
of the annual development budget of Kshs.218.99 billion—a decrease from the previous year's 58 per
cent. The Counties that attained the highest absorption rates of their respective approved development
budgets included Nandi at 90 per cent, Trans Nzoia at 77 per cent, Narok at 74 per cent, Meru at 73
per cent, and Kericho, Mandera, and Kirinyaga each at 72 per cent. In contrast, the Counties with the
lowest absorption rates of their respective approved development budgets included Machakos at 41
per cent, Kisii at 40 per cent, Elgeyo Marakwet at 39 per cent, Kiambu and Nyamira each at 37 per
cent, and Nairobi City and Kisumu each at 29 per cent.


As of June 30, 2025, the outstanding stock of pending bills amounted to Kshs.176.80 billion, marking
a 3 per cent decrease from Kshs.181.98 billion in FY 2023/24. This reduction was primarily attributable to the reconciliation of pending bills in Nairobi City County, which decreased by Kshs.39.78
billion. Significant pending bill balances were reported by Nairobi City (Kshs.86.77 billion), Kiambu
(Kshs.7.89 billion), and Machakos (Kshs.6.73 billion). In contrast, Narok's pending bill data was incomplete, hindering a comprehensive assessment of compliance and progress.

AUGUST, 2025


In FY 2024/25, the Controller of Budget identified critical challenges impeding effective budget execution across County Governments. Key issues include significant underperformance in Own Source
Revenue, where Counties missed their target of Kshs.87.67 billion by 23 per cent. High revenue arrears of Kshs.124.95 billion, exacerbating fiscal pressures. Overreliance on the Facility Improvement
Fund, which accounted for over 50 per cent of OSR for many Counties, poses a risk to financial sustainability. Additionally, pending bills soared to Kshs.176.80 billion, with over half being under three
years old. At the same time, development expenditures remained alarmingly low, as 23 Counties failed
to meet the 30 per cent threshold.


The expenditure landscape reveals excessive spending on employee compensation, with only eight
Counties staying within the 35 per cent regulatory ceiling. Furthermore, the health sector's wage bill
accounts for 44 per cent of total expenditures, raising concerns about financial management. Other
challenges include lapsing fund regulations, non-compliance with account opening legislation, and
delays submitting mandatory financial reports.


To rectify these issues in subsequent financial years, the Controller of Budget recommends the following strategic actions for County Governments: Develop realistic strategies to expand OSR and reduce
reliance on the Facility Improvement Fund; establish mechanisms to collect outstanding revenues and
amend legislation to incorporate pending bills into public debt definitions, ensure enhanced fiscal
accountability; adhere strictly to legal spending limits, particularly on employee compensation, and
prioritize sustainable development by effectively implementing growth-oriented programmes; review
and revise outdated fund regulations to prevent disruptions and halt expenditures from lapsed funds.


During FY 2024/25, monitoring and evaluation by the Controller of Budget across 36 County Governments revealed mixed project outcomes. While some initiatives progressed on schedule, others
faced significant delays and contract management weaknesses. Also, challenges were observed in the
procurement of medical supplies. Additionally, evaluations of equalisation-funded projects raised
concerns regarding their effectiveness and ability to bridge service delivery gaps. Ultimately, the Controller of Budget's recommendations focus on cultivating fiscal responsibility and enhancing operational transparency, ensuring County Governments can navigate these challenges and drive sustainable growth for their communities.
